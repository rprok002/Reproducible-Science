# Objectives
The objective of the analysis was to fit light-response curves to data collected at Harvard Forest in Massachusetts in order to better estimate net ecosystem exchange (NEE) from photosynthetic potential and plant respiration 


# Methods

## Site Information (include a map of the harvard forest site)

## Photosynthetic Potential

## Ecosystem Respiration

# Results (at least 1 plot and one table)

# Discussion (1 paragrapgh)
