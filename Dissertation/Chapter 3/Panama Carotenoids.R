## Carotenoids 

## MANOVA rules####
## Assumptions:
## Independent observations: Use intraclass correlation (ICC) in R to test, value is between -1 (strong neg correlation) and 1 (strong positive correlation)
## Normality: Shapiro-Wilks
## Equal variance: Box M Test

## Will be using one way MANOVA (I think)
