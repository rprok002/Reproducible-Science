## Research Statement:
I am a first-year graduate student at Florida International University. My research focus is amphibian conservation in the face of the chytrid fungus epidemic. More specifically, I am interested in the possible behavioral changes frogs may exhibit if able to detect and actively avoid infection by chytrid, the physiological mechanisms that could contribute to recognition and avoidance behavior, and the conservation policy changes that can come about through these studies. My study species is the marsupial frog, genus *Gastrotheca*, in high-elevation sites in Ecuador. 

## Objectives and Hypothesis:
As a preliminary portion of the project, I must first determine whether *Gastrotheca* frogs have the innate behavior in nature to  avoid chytrid fungus. I hypothesize that chytrid presence determines frog presence. If *Gastrotheca* frogs avoid chytrid fungus in nature, more frogs will be found in areas where chytrid is found versus areas where it is not found. 

## Methods (Data Selection and Analysis)
No data has been collected on amphibian presence density based on chytrid presence in Ecuador. In order to determine the best sites in Ecuador to study *Gastrotheca* frogs and chytrid presence, presence data of *Gastrotheca riobambae* and chytrid fungus will be compared through species distribution analysis. Frog presence data will be used from Bresciano et al. 2015 and GBIF. Chytrid distribution has yet to be determined.
